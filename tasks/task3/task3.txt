The task: explore how the training accuracy of neural network depends on:
    A) Number of features used to describe the pattern
    B) Number of classes
    C) Number of training samples

Necessary: to select the task you want the neural network will solve and to collect/ to generate training samples
Training mode: supervised training

Advised tool: Weka

Expected outcome: dependencies of error on the number of classes; number of features  and number training samples

Requirements for data: at least 20-30 examples for each class used; number of features needs to be between 5 and 10
